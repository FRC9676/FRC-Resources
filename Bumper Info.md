###Bumper materials
*We've mostly used RoboPromo bumper materials.
*Per Robopromo:"Hey, this is Robo promo. I did not confirm what kind of fabric you got. If you ordered regular fabric. It's going to be the shiny side. But if you ordered super slick or super tough, it's going to be on the doll side. so depending on which fabric you ordered that's That's the side you order. I meant you iron it done. So if you need to confirm it, just give us a call back and I'll confirm it with you.
