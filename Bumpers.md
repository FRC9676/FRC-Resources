## Bumper materials

### Numbers & decals
#### Suppliers:
* [Premier Printing](https://premierprintinginc.com/) (local)
  * Quoted $64 & tax for 8 sets of numbers (2025)
  * Cut vinyl & heat application available
* [RoboPromo](https://www.robopromo.com/) offers a variety of number options and they'll send free FIRST logos graphics for the bumpers (part of the Virtual Crate).

#### Applying graphics:
Per RoboPromo:
* For Regular Bumper Fabric, apply the numbers to the shiny side.
* For Super Slick or Super Tough, apply them to the dull side.

### Fabric
* We've mostly used RoboPromo bumper materials as the crates have contained their fabrics.

  * fussy, probably overkill, we could do better
