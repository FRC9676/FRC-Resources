# Bumper Info

### Bumper materials

#### Numbers & decals
* [Premier Printing](https://premierprintinginc.com/) (local)
 * Quoted $64 & tax for 8 sets of numbers (2025)
 * Cut vinyl & heat application available
* RoboPromo offers a variety of number options and they'll send free FIRST logos graphics for the bumpers (part of the Virtual Crate).

#### Fabric
* We've mostly used RoboPromo bumper materials as the crates have contained their fabrics.
* Per RoboPromo:
  * For Regular Bumper Fabric, apply the numbers to the shiny side.
  * For Super Slick or Super Tough, apply them to the dull side.
