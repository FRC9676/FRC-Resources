# Bumper materials

## Numbers & decals
### Suppliers:
* [Premier Printing](https://premierprintinginc.com/) (local)
  * Quoted $64 & tax for 8 sets of numbers (2025)
  * Cut vinyl & heat application available
* [Quik Print](https://quikprintllc.com/)
  * Cut vinyl number for $75 w/ tax (2025)
  * Subtract $15 for identical numbers (setup fee)
* [RoboPromo](https://www.robopromo.com/) offers a variety of number options and they'll send free FIRST logos graphics for the bumpers (part of the Virtual Crate).

### Applying graphics:
Per RoboPromo:
* For Regular Bumper Fabric, apply the numbers to the shiny side.
* For Super Slick or Super Tough, apply them to the dull side.

## Fabric
* We've mostly used RoboPromo bumper materials as the crates have contained their fabrics.

## Bumper mounts
* [AndyMark AM14U](https://www.andymark.com/products/am14u-family-bumper-brackets-and-fasteners-kit)
  * Has been included with the Kit of Parts
  * Built for the tank drive robot from the Kit of Parts
  * fussy, probably overkill, we could do better
* [RoboPromo Stud Plate Bumper Bracket Kit](https://www.robopromo.com/product_p/rp-2031.htm)
  * Comments: appears to be much easier to install and use

# Bumper construction & assembly
* [FIRST Robotics Competition Bumper Guide](https://www.firstinspires.org/sites/default/files/uploads/resource_library/frc/technical-resources/frc_bumperguide.pdf) (38-pages, 2025)
* [AM14U4 & AM14U5 Bumper Assembly - AndyMark YT](https://youtu.be/TK4s2QwKYeg?si=1Pu0YPQ12YzlQJ1w)
* Using the C2Makerspace press, 15s @ 375F worked but did melt the vinyl cloth a bit. Covering with fabric helped, but a proper setup should be researched.
