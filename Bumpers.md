# Bumper Info

### Bumper materials
* We've mostly used RoboPromo bumper materials as the crates have contained their fabrics and they'll send free FIRST graphics.
* Per RoboPromo:
  * For Regular Bumper Fabric, apply the numbers to the shiny side.
  * For Super Slick or Super Tough, apply them to the dull side.
